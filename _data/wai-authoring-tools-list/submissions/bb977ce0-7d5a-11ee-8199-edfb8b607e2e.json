  "accessible-content-production-possible-partially-description": "Wagtail places extensive restrictions on the production of web content, which all nonetheless allow for the production of accessible content, with the exception of:<br><br>- Missing support for marking images as decorative / setting alt text in context for image chooser fields. See _B.1.1.2 Content Auto-Generation During Authoring Sessions (WCAG)_. This could be worked around by only creating images within rich text fields, which is possible but unlikely.- Missing support for table/row headers with TypedTableBlock. This could be worked around by only creating tables with TableBlock, which is possible but unlikely.<br>- Missing support for setting `lang` attributes within rich text. This could be worked around by using other types of content modeling for multilingual content, which is possible but unlikely.",
  "accessible-templates-available-partially-description": "With rich text formatting and StreamField blocks, Wagtail provides templates for basic text content as well as complex formatting like tables. Wagtail also provides templates for form fields within its forms module.

  "alt-available-partially-description": "Wagtail provides alternative text for all images within the CMS, but in five prominent cases the programmatically-associated text isn’t the best possible one. All icons have appropriate alt text, and Wagtail has no built-in support for videos.<br><br>See https://wagtail.org/accessibility/atag-audit/#a211-text-alternatives-for-rendered-non-text-content for specific occurrences where we are aware improvement is needed.<br>question-presentation-programmatically-determined: partially<br>presentation-programmatically-determined-partially-description: Wagtail uses the following status indicators in editing views:<br><br>- Fail: Comments on fields. Comments are displayed as a 'speech bubble' icon next to the field they are associated with. The association isn’t programmatically exposed. Even visually, the presence of a comment can only be identified on hover/focus within the field’s area.<br>- Fail: Comments in rich text. Comments are displayed as highlighted text within the rich text field. The association isn’t programmatically exposed.<br>- Pass: Character count for rich text fields. The character count is displayed as a number next to the field it is associated with. The association is programmatically exposed with `aria-describedby` ('Character count: 18/120').",
  "alternatives-manageable-partially-description": "Though Wagtail provides support for editing alt text everywhere images can be added, it doesn’t provide support for marking images as decorative (set to empty alt text), or changing alt text in context.",
  "auto-content-accessible-partially-description": "Wagtail automatically generates content in a few scenarios. In the following scenarios, markup is accessible without further work:<br><br>- Pass: Links markup for links to pages, documents, external URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and internal anchors within rich text fields.<br>- Pass: Embeds for external resources within rich text fields.<br>- Pass: Embeds for external resources in StreamField.<br>- Pass: Image markup for images in rich text fields. Images are rendered with alt text from an editable field, and a checkbox to mark the image as decorative.<br>- Pass: Table markup from TableBlock.<br><br>In the following scenarios, markup isn’t accessible out of the box:<br><br>- Fail: Image markup for images in other content. By default, Wagtail does not make it possible to change the image’s alt text in context, and doesn’t make it possible to mark images as decorative.<br>- Fail: Table markup from TypedTableBlock. This is lacking the ability to set row or column headers.<br><br>Wagtail provides automatic checking for specific accessibility problems but this checking is only performed when authors use the full-screen live preview, and there is no prompt / suggestion to perform this check (or any other).",
  "automatically-checks-partially-description": "There are a number of formatting / content entry options in the CMS that can lead to accessibility issues. The built-in accessibility checker provides automated tests for a number of possible issues, but not all. Available checks are:<br><br>- button-name: button elements must always have a text label.<br>- empty-heading: This rule checks for headings with no text content. Empty headings are confusing to screen readers users and should be avoided.<br>- empty-table-header: Table header text should not be empty<br>- frame-title: iframe elements must always have a text label.<br>- heading-order: This rule checks for incorrect heading order. Headings should be ordered in a logical and consistent manner, with the main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).<br>- input-button-name: input button elements must always have a text label.<br><br>- link-name: a link elements must always have a text label.<br>- p-as-heading: This rule checks for paragraphs that are styled as headings. Paragraphs should not be styled as headings, as they don’t help users who rely on headings to navigate content.<br><br><br>There are a number of success criteria that do not have automated checks nor instructions for manual checking:<br><br>- 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A) – specifically instructions on correct entry of alt text, and marking images as decorative when appropriate<br>- 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (AA) – instructions and potentially limited automated checks on correct link text (avoid 'click here')<br>- 1.4.5 Images of Text (AA) – instructions on avoiding images of text except for scenarios where there is no alternative<br>- 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (AAA) – see above<br>- 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (AAA) – see above<br>- 3.1.5 Reading Level (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks<br>- 2.4.10 Section Headings (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks<br>- 3.3.5 Help (AAA) – instructions for manual checking or automated checks for the form builder<br><br><br>All of Wagtail’s checks are pass/fail and as such require no author input.
